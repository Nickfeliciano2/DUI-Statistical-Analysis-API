"Notes"
"The unemployment rate measures unemployment within the civilian non-institutional population aged 16 years and older. Data refer to place of residence. Data for Puerto Rico are derived from a monthly household survey similar to the Current Population Survey. Area definitions are based on Office of Management and Budget Bulletin No. 15-01, dated July 15, 2015, and are available on the BLS website at [http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm](http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm). Numerical data are rounded to the nearest thousand. State numerical data may not sum to the national total due to rounding. "
