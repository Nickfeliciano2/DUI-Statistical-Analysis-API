U.S. and state population data displayed on this site are restricted to the civilian, non-institutionalized population for whom ACS collects and reports poverty information. Please note that in the past, population data posted to this site had used the Current Population Survey. We have replaced all previously-posted data, including data for previous years, with data based on ACS.   "
